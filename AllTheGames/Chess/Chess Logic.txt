Steps for ooking for check
Whites turn
So check if any black pieces have placed the king in check
Also need to make sure moving another piece will put your king in check
So lets start with the obvious ones, the first thing
1. Run through each piece on the board
2. Test if its a black piece
	a. If it is, run its available moves and mark those spots
	b. If its not, skip it
3.Check if the king is in a marked spots
4.If it is the king is in check
Now we wanna make sure pieces know if theyre putting the king in or out of check
ugh
This parts haaaaaard
